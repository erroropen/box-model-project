        <p class="part1">Tanjiro Kamado (Japanese: 竈門 炭治郎, Hepburn: Kamado Tanjirō) is a fictional character and the protagonist of Koyoharu
        Gotouge's manga Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. Tanjiro goes on a quest to restore the humanity of his sister, Nezuko,
        who was turned into a demon after his family was killed by Muzan Kibutsuji following an attack that resulted in the
        death of his other relatives. After an encounter with Giyu Tomioka, a demon slayer, Tanjiro is recruited by Giyu to also
        become a demon slayer to help his sister turn human again and avenge his family. Besides Ufotable's Demon Slayer:
        Kimetsu no Yaiba anime adaptation, Tanjiro has also appeared in a light novel that acts as a prequel to the manga.
        
        Gotouge created Tanjiro following a suggestion from their editor of having a bright main character who would stand out
        in his dark narrative. His design was influenced by Himura Kenshin from Nobuhiro Watsuki's manga Rurouni Kenshin when
        deciding how androgynous the character should look. The character is primarily voiced by Natsuki Hanae in Japanese and
        Zach Aguilar in English.
        
        The character has been well received by manga and anime critics due to his caring nature and relationship with his
        sister while also becoming a strong fighter. This has led to the character winning multiple awards with Hanae's
        performance as him also receiving one. Aguilar's performance was also well-received. <img src="tanjiro 5.jpg" height="100">

        <p class="part2">anjiro Kamado originates from Koyoharu Gotouge's ideas involving a one-shot with Japanese motifs. Tatsuhiko Katayama,
        their editor, was worried about the one-shot crusade being too dark for the young demographic and asked Gotouge if they
        could write another type of the main character who would be "brighter".[3] Gotouge has cited issues in the making of the
        character due to the contrast he has with the dark narrative. For the release of the manga's seventh chapter, Gotouge
        drew a cover of Tanjiro wielding his sword while smiling. However, due to the contrasting aesthetics the manga had, they
        discarded the drawing and instead drew a similar design with Tanjiro having a serious expression.[4]
        
        In the initial design, Tanjiro did not have a scar or wear earrings, but in the end, they felt these features
        accentuated the character. In the making of the cast, Tanjiro had four supporting characters who would balance each
        other due to their different skills. The editor commented about Tanjiro, "[He] is a type of male main character that you
        don't see much. He's so kind. He has Nezuko, so he's coming from this position where he can't just say all demons are
        absolute evil. He's in the gray zone." Tanjiro's design was also influenced by Gotouge's editor: he suggested giving
        Tanjiro a facial scar in his forehead inspired by Himura Kenshin from Nobuhiro Watsuki's manga Rurouni Kenshin while
        also giving him earrings to balance how androgynous he would look.[3]
